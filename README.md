# FitnessClub

Fully responsive Fitness Website with pin point muscle exercise

The React Fitness Application, enhanced with RapidAPI integration, offers an advanced and dynamic fitness experience by leveraging third-party APIs through the RapidAPI platform. This integration adds a new layer of functionality and data to the application, enriching the user experience and providing real-time access to a wide range of fitness-related resources.

Exercise Database: Through the integration with RapidAPI, the application can tap into an expansive exercise database API. Users can search for a diverse array of exercises, each with detailed descriptions, images, and video demonstrations. This ensures that users have access to accurate and up-to-date exercise information.
